# EnergyConservationSimulation

The simulation is hosted at https://energy-conservation-simulation.herokuapp.com/

This was a simulation for my AP Physics Class demonstrating the conservation of mechanical energy as it pertains to spring potential energy, a moving object's potential and kinetic energy, and the effects of friction. Users can input different values for the object's mass, the spring's rigidity constant and compression distance, the ramp angle, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between the ball and the ground/ramp.

###### *Within the code, both 'ball' and 'block' refer to the singular moving object, at different points in development it was represented differently.*
